# These are the Days of PayPal

## Overview and Orgin
PayPal origins began in December 1998 as a Palm Pilot dedicated application called Fieldlink.  The initial idea behind Fieldlink was sending IOUs from user to user via Palm Pilot’s built-in infrared ports.  The product also allowed users to make payments on purchased goods or exchange money between accounts in a secure online transaction.  The founders of this technology Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, Ken Howrey and Luke Nosek formed the company known as Confinity to market this new application. Later it was determined Palm Pilot’s technology was not needed to transfer money as Fieldlink’s software could be used via email and the internet.  This new discovery/product is what we call PayPal today.

In March 2000, PayPal went through growing pains when it merged with X.com (founded by Elon Musk).  The company was in the red for a period when led by Elon Musk; however, due to a successful coup, Elon Musk was removed as CEO of PayPal and Peter Thiel was named interim CEO.

In 2002, PayPal decided it was time to seek a buyer and approached Google and Yahoo with a minimum price of $600M; however, neither company was interested in purchasing the company.  After the denial of purchase from Google and Yahoo, PayPal decided to prepare for an IPO.  PayPal’s declaration to become a public company caused eBay (one of PayPal’s main customers) to offer $400M to purchase the company – PayPal rejected this deal as they felt their market cap was closer to $1.2B.  eBay eventually paid $1.5B for PayPal in 2002.  In 2015, PayPal was divested into an independent company. 

## Business Activities & Landscape
One of PayPal’s initial goals was to limit the number of fraudulent activities using digital wallet.  This technology will allow customers and businesses to interact via the web.  As of 2021, PayPal is used by sole proprietorships, online and brick and mortar businesses as well as individuals.  PayPal’s user base was listed as 143M in 2013 and has grown over 250% with 2020 user count being 377M. 

One way PayPal differentiates itself from competitors is you can transfer up to $10,000 in a transaction.  PayPal also utilizes QR code for in store purchases and Pay Later, which allows a user to spread purchase price over a down payment and three installments. 

One of the interesting technologies used by PayPal is Premortem Analysis.  This strategy allows PayPal to imagine a project has failed and then works backwards to determine what could have led to that failure.  This helps the company talk about what could go wrong prior to launching a new project. 

To maintain a competitive advantage over its peers – Google Pay, Intuit, Amazon Pay, Venmo, Shopify Payments, Klarna, Apple Pay (to name a few) - in the digital payment industry, PayPal has recently launched a cryptocurrency investing service.  Entering the cryptocurrency arena, allows PayPal to compete with Square, who introduced bitcoin investing in 2017. 

## Results
To assist in comparing companies within the digital payments industry, we would use the following metrics:
1.	Gross transaction volume – indicator of top line, provides insight into total payments processed
2.	Payment initiation rate – indicator of intent to pay
3.	Payment success rate – indicator of successful payments over total payments initiated
PayPal being the long-term incumbent of this industry, lead in the metrics mentioned above.
